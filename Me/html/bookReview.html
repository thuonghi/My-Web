                        <h4>1. First Impressions</h4>
                        <p>“A book on minimalism” is the book I was given as a gift. There's obviously not a design breakthrough on the cover of the book, but I enjoyed it for two reasons. Firstly, the drawing of a girl next to a cat is familiar enough to make me scream in my head "Hey me, this book is for people like me!". Secondly, the cover design shows a simple, young, modern approach that suits you. To be honest, I personally am very shy of books on minimalistic topics that have heavy cover designs on religion, spirituality, meditation, beads, flower branches, etc. far away meditation" style "dreaming away from the world" is not my personality and I prefer simple, modern, close things like this.

                        <p>
                            Only such a few initial descriptions could help envision a straightforward, simple, logical tone of voice! As a young person, I think you will consult and read more about the authors and their works. They will have sharp and rich observations, their thinking has Eastern values and Western civilization. And the important thing is that they share their life experiences, they don't "teach" you. Minimalism is not a "meditation" or a "religion" but the daily life we still live.

                        <img src="/img/bookReview-content.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>The book is divided into three fairly simple parts. Part 1. The beginning will give you author Chi Nguyen's understanding of minimalism, not in the way of minimalism, must be this, must be that, but suggest to you how you yourself can simplify your life. Live your life the way that makes you feel good. The most readable highlights of this part 1 are the most common misunderstandings about minimalism (and dissolving it), such as:

                                Single children can be minimalist
                                Throwing things away is a waste, it's a crime
                                Minimalism is only suitable for "western"
                                Minimalism is stingy
                            Read the section on these misunderstandings carefully, you will see that there are thoughts that "always thought so" are not really like that.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you live in a house full of furniture (and dust), can't clean nooks and crannies, feel sluggish all the time, every time you have to find something to be boring, then this book will remind you. give you tips on how to start to simplify your furniture. Actually downsizing has some tricks in it, read on and you'll find it's not as difficult as you think. Personally, I am also in the process of simplifying the furniture in my house, at first I find it a bit difficult because I am the type who likes to keep memories, but gradually I find that my body has more energy, a happier life, a house. Cleaner, more alert mind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Besides exterior furniture, minimalism can also be applied with inner thinking to make your life and relationships lighter. Read Part 2 of the book and you will realize that you've been letting too many petty things bother you unnecessarily. I must say that since reading this part, I have noticed that my life has changed a lot. My way of working is different, my thinking is more focused and especially, my relationships are better.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Part 3, as the name implies, is an action plan. This is the part that sets this book apart from other self-help books. The author doesn't show you how to act like everyone knows what it is but almost no one can do it. The author wrote this section in the position of a friend of yours. That is, Chi fully understands the difficulties and prejudices that you and your friends face when making life decisions for yourself. In eastern society, civilized reduction is often seen as selfish. Chi will not teach you coldly, but will accompany you through all the difficult pressures you will face ahead.

                        <h4>4. SOME Nice quotes IN THE BOOK</h4>
                        <p>" I've heard a lot of people say that only living in the "west" or developed countries can realize a minimalist lifestyle because foreigners are modern and civilized, and "Vietnamese people" are too used to living in the world. Collecting and storing things for generations. At times like these, I just want to put on loudspeakers to shout: "That's why minimalism was born for Vietnam!!!" Many Vietnamese families live with many generations, adding one member every few years, and the house is getting more cramped every day. With the need to live growing day by day, if the furniture is not discarded, soon every family will be flooded with the worthless items they bring home and keep in the house. More dangerously, over time, it is easy to see living in clutter, excess, and stuffiness as obvious and no longer motivated to change."</p>
                        <p>"The reason many people like gossip is because it makes people feel closer to each other, more beautiful, happier, more valued when knowing other people are ugly, miserable, unappreciated."</p>
                        <p>"Many times, expectations of others come from love, from the desire to do the best for others without realizing that you are putting pressure on your loved one. In relationships, too, there are many couples who are extremely happy to date – but after marriage become more uncomfortable, more demanding with each other because they have higher expectations. It seems that when we become a family, we feel like we have the "right" and "responsibility" to control, shape, and change the behavior and personality of our spouse/children."</p>
