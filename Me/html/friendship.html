                        <p>The psychological truth about the relationship "thought to be" best friends in this era, what will it look like?</p>
                        <p>It's really strange guys, we go to university together, we eat together, we talk a lot, but it feels like everyone is not really friends.</p>
                        <p>I have a friend, he always criticizes me for choosing bad clothes, and he doesn't mind at all. Maybe it's because after he finished speaking, I also laughed and responded as if nothing was wrong.</p>
                        <p>Many times when I said that I plan to do something in the future, he laughed and brushed it off like you're just crazy.</p>
                        <p>Everyone who looks at it will tell me, but I feel like it doesn't respect what I say</p>
                        <p>Every day they go to school together, they stick together like a sam, eating and drinking, talking bad about a child that they both hate.</p>
                        <p>And when I'm on vacation, I don't see each other's faces, even when I surf facebook, I'm afraid to comment.</p>
                        <p>She and I started a friendship from hating the same girl. And ended friendship because of a boy.</p>
                        <p>You "thought to be close" means those who have nothing, just like what are called "traveling friends", sometimes meet, laugh together, eat together.</p>
                        <p>They don't care if they have flaws or injuries.</p>
                        <p>All those friends and hangovers are all over the street. And if we talk about our feet rotten, for example, rest assured, these people do not look at us with much disdain.</p>
                        <p>Because they don't really care about me.</p>
                        <p>Drinking friends are very crowded, everywhere and even after talking, they pat each other on the shoulder.</p>
                        <p>Gradually we will realize that the more you are innocuous, the less valuable you are to each other, the less you judge each other's people, the easier it is to create a feeling of intimacy.</p>
                        <p>There is a psychological truth: every relationship is essentially a burden.</p>
                        <p>So you'll quickly find out that the more people you hang out with, the more you talk to them, the more they say innocuous sentences.</p>
                        <p>When we talk about our problems, they often say, "Oh, you don't have to think about this, I've met this, my uncle has it too", or "Oh, I have a friend who has it too." .</p>
                        <p>"You just go online and search for it." "Or you should buy insoles to reduce foot odor", "You wear shoes, if your shoes hurt too much, you should wear slippers"...</p>
                        <p>It sounds very friendly on the outside, very affectionate, but actually has no weight at all.</p>
                        <p>There is a type of person who is very confident “I have dozens of close friends”, but psychologically that person has completely lost himself in life.</p>
                        <p>No longer truly me, no longer natural, no longer confident, no longer even face-to-face. Only if you are used to enjoying each other's company, then you have that kind of "a bunch of close friends"</p>
                        <p>If you talk to people like Mr. Pham Nhat Vuong, for example, or very successful people in society, like Jack Ma or Bill Gates, if you ask them "Who is your best friend?" They could only name a few friends.</p>
                        <p>Those friends of theirs are people who share their ideals and values, who share their memories, their loyalty, their values, their feelings for each other.</p>
                        <p>Those are the things that are immeasurable and extremely rare in life. They may even give up saying the names of people close to them – that is very normal.</p>
                        <p>Those are the people who have true friendships. They succeed because they have overcome the illusions of life.</p>
                        <p>Friendship "thought to be close" is like a black and white photo that has been stained, still wants to keep looking but can't see anything anymore, but is confused between whether to keep or throw it away.</p>
